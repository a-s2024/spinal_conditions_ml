Based on the above, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is the best choice for deployment due to its performance across all metrics:

- Highest Accuracy: SVM achieved 81.72%, which is the highest among the three models.

- F1 Score: SVM also has the highest F1 Score at 0.8121, indicating a good balance between precision and recall.

- Precision and Recall: SVM has strong precision (0.8112) and recall (0.8172), showing it consistently identifies cases accurately.

- The confusion matrix also reflects that SVM classifies each class more accurately compared to KNN and Naive Bayes, especially in correctly identifying true positive instances for each class.

- SVM correctly classifies more instances in all classes, with fewer misclassifications across classes compared to KNN and Naive Bayes.
Class 3 is especially well-classified with only 1 misclassified instance, showing SVMâ€™s performance even with class imbalance.
